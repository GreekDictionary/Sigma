                        The ContentPresenter is used to scale and offset the content of ZoomAndPanControl.
                    
                        A transforms computed from 'ContentScale', 'ContentOffsetX' and 'ContentOffsetY' are assigned 
                        to the 'RenderTransform' property in OnApplyTemplate in ZoomAndPanControl.cs.
                        
                        The alignment is set to top-left.  This allows the content offset to be used to place
                        the content in the center of the viewport when the viewport is bigger than the content.
